# Nextcloud Update-Script

This script features an automatic Backup & Update of your Nextcloud installation, using occ.<br \>
The script will check your installed version (e.g. 10.0.0) and the latest release-version (e.g. 10.0.2).<br \>
If an update is available, the script will backup the following folders: /data, /config, /themes, /apps<br \>
It also backups your current database - just in case, the upgrade goes wrong!

The script will check whether the backup was successful or not, and then it begins the update process by downloading the latest release.

If everything goes as expected, the script will use the occ upgrade command to upgrade your nextcloud installation.  You will receive an email upon successful installation. If the upgrade process fails, your database will be restored

That's it! Visit your website and enjoy the latest version of Nextcloud!
